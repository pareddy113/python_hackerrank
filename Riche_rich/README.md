Problem statement:
Andy likes palindromes. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as it does forward. For example, madam is a palindrome.

On her  birthday, Sandy's uncle, Richie Rich, offered her an -digit check which she refused because the number was not a palindrome. Richie then challenged Sandy to make the number palindromic by changing no more than digits. Sandy can only change  digit at a time, and cannot add digits to (or remove digits from) the number.

Given  and an n-digit number, help Sandy determine the largest possible number she can make by changing digits.

Note: Treat the integers as numeric strings. Leading zeros are permitted and can't be ignored (So 0011 is not a palindrome, 0110 is a valid palindrome). A digit can be modified more than once.

Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers,n  (the number of digits in the number) and k (the maximum number of digits that can be altered), respectively. 
The second line contains an n-digit string of numbers that Sandy must attempt to make palindromic.
